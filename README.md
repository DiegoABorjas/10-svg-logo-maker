  ## Description
  This is a command line application that takes in user input to generate a logo and save it as an SVG file. The application prompts the user to select a color and shape, provide text for the logo, and save the generated SVG to a .svg file.

  ---  

  ## The application has to include the following acceptance criteria:

  ```md
    GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
    WHEN I am prompted for text
    THEN I can enter up to three characters
    WHEN I am prompted for the text color
    THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
    WHEN I am prompted for a shape
    THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
    WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
    THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
    WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
    THEN an SVG file is created named logo.svg
    AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
    WHEN I open the logo.svg file in a browser
    THEN I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
  ```
